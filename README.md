# OpenCV random scripts
It's basically a repository with random scripts that I created while reminding myself how to use OpenCV while beginning 
working on TIAGo robot in Hong Kong :).

# Requirements
To run the scripts you need to install requirements specified in `requirements.txt` file. You can do it by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
PS. Best to do it in a virtual environment ;)
